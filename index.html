    <h1>Do You Hear It?</h1>
    
    <p>
        The whispers started at midnight. They were faint at first, like the rustling of leaves in an empty forest. 
        But soon, they became voices—muttering, gasping, pleading. I tried to ignore them, thinking it was my imagination. 
        But then the scratching began.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Something was inside the walls.
    </p>

    <p>
        I pressed my ear against the cold plaster, my breath hitching. The scratching grew louder, more frantic. 
        It wasn't a rat. It wasn't the pipes. It was something else. And then, I heard my name.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Come closer," it whispered.
    </p>

    <p>
        My blood ran cold. I stumbled back, but my body refused to run. The lights flickered, and in that brief moment 
        of darkness, I felt something behind me. Something breathing. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The TV screen turned on by itself. Static filled the room. And in the flickering light, I saw movement—shadowy, 
        crawling figures on the walls. Their faces were wrong. Twisted. Hungry. The whispers turned into laughter.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Play the video," they urged.
    </p>

    <p>
        My hands shook as I reached for my phone. The file was already open. The play button was waiting.

    </video>

    <p>
        And then, the final whisper came. Closer than before. Right against my ear.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Listen..."
    </p>

    <audio controls>
        <source src="Audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

    </audio>

    <p>
        The screen went black. The whispers stopped. And then, in the silence, something else began to breathe.
